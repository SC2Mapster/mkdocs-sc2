# [3:00 AM] Talv: damn, getting started feels a bit overwhleming now
# [3:01 AM] Talv: I like that you outlined what you want put in each section, I think I might find suitable topic
# [3:02 AM] Talv: consider splitting getting started into sections, for each subject: galaxy, ui, styles, data etc.
# [3:06 AM] Talv: IMO all these code snippets that are currently there should be moved to relevant category
# [3:08 AM] Talv: with all the stuff you've outlined there, I think it might be worth to introduce another navigation level
# - I mean top menu. with Getting Started being the first entry, and then UI, Galaxy etc.
