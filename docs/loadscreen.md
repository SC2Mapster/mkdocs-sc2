* XXX add in a few complete loading screen examples
* XXX explain how to use JPEG image files in the loading screen
* XXX explain how to use the editbox hack and wait-for-key to inspect the UI
* XXX explain how to reanchor/reuse the text entered in the Map Options for Loading screen (and also how the soft limit on characters in the map options is irrelevant, and mostly there to fit in the standard loading screen label)
