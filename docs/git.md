* XXX tutorial for how to get the map in git and work with it

I mean what the hell are we supposed to say?

```
[3:14 AM] Alevice: its rather expalin why git/svn are good and shit
[3:14 AM] Alevice: probab√±y recommend private free hosts
[3:14 AM] Alevice: how to set it up
[3:14 AM] Alevice: and thats it
[3:14 AM] Regendare: basic "git" terminology would be good as well
[3:15 AM] Talv: yeah, so basically a bunch of links to other tutorials that cover it? :P
[3:18 AM] Talv: well, it will probably be good to outline which parts of map are git-friendly. I mean point out that terrain files etc. won't be merged by default git merger and stuff like that(edited)
[3:19 AM] Alevice: yeah well, the point of witing it would be for people who have just started programming or whatevs with sc2
[3:25 AM] Talv: yeah, that's why I'd do it on Windows, and explain from point 0 - how to install, what to install, how to use. but was just thinking what beyond that - i.e. whether there is anything specific in sc2 workflow and is worth mentioning in regards to version controls
[3:38 AM] Alevice: mostyl collabs
[3:38 AM] Alevice: its easier to contribute that way rather than dropbox which many mapmakers do
[3:39 AM] Alevice: other than that i cant think of anything
[3:39 AM] Alevice: i often suggest using soruce tree
[3:40 AM] Alevice: pro ably a way to "build"
[3:40 AM] Alevice: so it can then be published
[3:43 AM] Alevice: something i would love to suggest is catalog id sanitization
[3:43 AM] Alevice: how to properly duplicate whne needed so you are not affected by patches and shit
[3:43 AM] Talv: soucetree looks good, will go with that I guess - as an addition to explaining how to use git from command line, because after all - this tutorial kinda targets aspiring devs
[3:44 AM] Alevice: true
[3:44 AM] Alevice: source tree comes with its own bash executable iirc
[3:45 AM] Alevice: re: id sanitization, i basically want to push it because we had some compatability issues when we used mass recall as a base mod since there was no sanitization there
[3:46 AM] Alevice: (part of why i had wanted to work on this: https://github.com/abrahamYG/SC2plusSCBW/wiki/Low-level-Design)
```
