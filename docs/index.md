# Welcome!

## Introduction

Jump to the [Getting Started](setup.md) section to get started on the main tutorial, or explore any topic at your leisure. The search functionality in the top bar runs entirely in JavaScript in your browser, on a precompiled dictionary, so you need JS enabled for it to work. Other than that, the documentation does not require JS, as far as I am aware.

The menu on the left side of the screen (or in the hamburger menu in the top left corner on smaller screens) contains the topic sections for the documentation.

The menu on the right side of the screen (hidden on smaller screens) is a table of contents for each topic, and consists only of links that jump around in the current document - so these links never actually change the browsers page.

To get back to this introduction document, you click the icon in the top left (or inside the hamburger menu.)

## Helpful Links

For various interpersonal internet drama reasons, there are several Discords for map making. The first three are quite enough for getting sc2edit help.

* [Sc2mapster](https://discord.gg/JMat2NX) - covers everything related to SC2 modding, including arcade
* [Mapper Tavern](https://discord.gg/6g8vwds) - same as above
* [Mapper's Circle](https://discord.gg/X2DUHQA) - covers mostly Melee terraining
* [ARK Star](https://discord.gg/SpndCHZ) - dedicated to the premium map
* [Direct Strike](https://discord.gg/RHW92UA) - dedicated to the premium map
* [The Arcade Place](https://discord.gg/ZrC6FBY)

The source for this documentation site itself is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/SC2Mapster/mkdocs-sc2). The link in the top right points to SC2+Heroes of the Storm game data, which is a helpful asset. There is a tiny persistent icon in the lower right in the footer that links to the organization.

## Disclaimers

There are no cookies, analytics, or tracking, embedded in any of the documentation here, as far as we are aware. If the `mkdocs` software that it runs on uses cookies, it is probably related to the search functionality. I don't think it does, and I don't care enough to even open the cookie management UI to find out.

## Copyrights/license

All code blocks, files, and images/media of any type you find anywhere in the documentation can be used freely under the UNLICENSE, unless it belongs to some external entity like Github, Microsoft, or Blizzard (like some images, perhaps). Check the link in the footer for more information. If you copy something directly and want to be nice, then mention somewhere in your map that you found code/assets here.

Essentially, the above paragraph means: take and use code+images+files you find on this site in any way you see fit, with or without telling your users where you got it.

All prose and written words (like this paragraph, for example) belong entirely to their author. You may check the commit history on Github, or look at git-blame, to find the author for any section you want to copy, and ask them directly.

## Contributions

We welcome all pull requests, tickets, and other forms of contributions to the documentation. If you have useful code snippets you want to share, or want to correct anything we've written, then please do so. Thank you.

All the documentation is written in Markdown, with a few syntax extensions for the collapsible boxes among other small things.

Everyone makes mistakes, and noone is perfect. This documentation has - for the most part - not really been "audited" for correctness as such. It is more a stew of knowledge that most people would have put in a wiki. But wikis suck, so we used `mkdocs` instead.

This documentation is about code and helping eachother. There are no contributor guidelines - either you're an adult and can handle discussion/feedback on any contributions you might offer, or you can get fucked.

As a willing contributor, you consent to licensing any code/image/file contributions under the UNLICENSE, and understand that your written word remains your copyright.
