# Getting Started with SC2 development

Nowadays there is only one way of developing maps/mods/libraries for Starcraft II that makes any sense. You may think that your workflow is superior, or that you - personally - work faster or "better" in whatever development environment you are currently using.

You are - put simply - wrong.

The main purpose of this site is to enlighten you, help you, and guide you in how to set up your development environment for Starcraft II modding in the most efficient way we know how.

This guide works for both Windows and Linux development. Some advanced tools in other sections of the guide may use or refer to some command line tools that may require additional setup on Windows. But the Getting Started section is universal for both.

For Mac users, things might be different. I don't care about you. If you care, you are welcome to contribute to the guide to make it usable for Mac.

## How to use this tutorial

The "Getting Started" section of this site is a single, continous tutorial for how to set up your development environment for working mainly with SC2 map projects.

The way to read it is simple: top to bottom.

You are on step #1; Introduction. After this, read section #2; Nomenclature.

Once you reach the bottom of each page, continue to the next section in the menu on the left side (or using the hamburger menu on smaller screens.) Alternatively, there are back/forward links in the footer (the black area below this paragraph.)
